# Silverline Tutoring

Silverline Tutoring is an educational 501(c)(3) nonprofit connecting tutors and students within our organization of over 4500 dedicated members. Founded by college and high school students, this company recognizes the difficulty of learning—we’ve all been there.

From the depths of math to complex texts in English, every student has struggled at one point or another. We want to bridge this divide in education by providing free tutoring to any student. But how do we accomplish this difficult task?

# Organization Goals

At Silverline, we want to solve the education divide, one student at a time, by making learning enjoyable and stress-free for all. Therefore, we never hold students accountable to a strict schedule and always work based on the student needs, allowing them to benefit the most. Our tutors are vetted in advance to ensure that they are student-friendly and adaptable. Monthly trivia contests and other games are also held to promote a fun learning environment. We want to set our students up for success while building a strong community that facilitates opportunities for everyone involved. Because of this foundation, our community now serves up to 4500 members.

# Our Target Group

Silverline is primarily for students in high school. However, our reach extends beyond simply highschoolers. We also offer services to elementary and middle schoolers and college-level students, depending on the course. Our diverse group of tutors allows us to serve a greater population of people.

Additionally, aside from students, adults and any other age group are also welcome if they are looking for a refresher in a past course or simply looking to learn something new.

In terms of tutors, Silverline accepts anyone from sophomore year of highschool and above. In the past, we have had school teachers helping in our system, meaning that even adults are more than welcome to join our community. Therefore, regardless of age or education, Silverline is an open outlet for all groups whether it be in the form of being a student or a teacher.
