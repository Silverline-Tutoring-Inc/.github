## Silverline Tutoring

Silverline Tutoring is an educational 501(c)(3) nonprofit connecting tutors and students within our organization of over 4500 dedicated members. Founded by college and high school students, this company recognizes the difficulty of learning—we’ve all been there.

From the depths of math to complex texts in English, every student has struggled at one point or another. We want to bridge this divide in education by providing free tutoring to any student. But how do we accomplish this difficult task?
